# Decisions

## 2026-10-02: Linear while we build, GitHub Issues once we open source
**Decision:** The core team plans in Linear during the private build phase. When the app is released as open source, the backlog moves to GitHub Issues and the org-level GitHub Project (`docs/github-project.md`).

**Why:** Until release, a small core team does the planning, and Linear's triage, cycles and roadmaps work better for that. After release, the backlog has to be public and sit where contributors already are, and that's GitHub.

**What this means now:**
- Planning (ideas, triage, cycles, roadmap) happens in Linear.
- Scopes and decisions stay as markdown in this repo (`docs/scopes/`, `docs/decisions.md`), not in Linear. That way they move over at release without being rewritten.
- The GitHub Project setup (`docs/github-project.md`, `scripts/setup-github-project.sh`) is on hold until release. Don't create the board yet.
- The designer repo already tracks its work in GitHub issues (25 issues, all closed). Its future design work moves into Linear too, unless design decides otherwise.

**To keep the move cheap later:**
- Connect Linear's GitHub integration from day one, so pull requests and branches link to Linear issues.
- Use the same labels in Linear as on GitHub: priority (`must fix` / `should fix` / `nice to have`), who it helps (`member value` / `sponsor value` / `organizer value`), and kind of work (`design`, `engineering`, `scope`, `accessibility`, `documentation`). Also use the same fields: Feature area, Platform, Size, Phase.
- Keep issue text free of private details (sponsor terms, member data, internal links). That way issues can be copied to the public repos as they are.

**When we release:**
1. Run `scripts/setup-github-project.sh` and finish the manual steps in `docs/github-project.md`.
2. Move only the open, relevant issues to GitHub. Closed history stays in Linear.
3. Add a "good first issue" label and contributor docs before we announce.
4. Archive the Linear team, or keep it for organizer-only work such as sponsors and venues.

**Answered (2026-10-02, from the product owner):**
- "Released to open source" means the first public release, when the app repo is made public. The app hasn't been built yet.
- Design work moves into Linear now, not at release. The designer repo's GitHub issues become history. New design work is filed in Linear.
- Sponsor and venue work stays private "to some extent". This depends on how the web platform is split between the public and organizers (see the next decision).
- The product owner will connect Linear and Figma to this agent when the time comes.

**Still open:**
- Which parts of the organizer and sponsor work stay private in Linear after the release? This depends on the web platform split.
- Should the designer repo's README point its work queue at Linear? It can't until the Linear workspace exists.

## 2026-10-02: Scope covers the app and a web platform (still open)
**What we know:** Besides the Compose Multiplatform app, we're building a web platform. It serves two groups: the public, and organizers. It could be two separate products, or one product where organizer features are switched on only for organizers.

**Status:** not decided. The product owner will go through it during onboarding. Until then, scopes cover the app only. Any scope that needs an organizer tool (event setup, check-in, sponsor reports) flags that need instead of assuming where the tool lives.

**Needs an answer:** one web platform with organizer features switched on per user, or two separate platforms? Who uses each one? Which parts ship before the January testing window?
